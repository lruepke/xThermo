  Functions require a logical argument prop->phase.

  For phase != TWO functions directly use the fundamental equation,
  which in the two-phase region produces some kind of meta stable
  properties. If they fail (error = 1), no definit solution can be found.

  For phase == TWO functions simply ignore the fact that the
  steam quota can only be 0 <= x <= 1. If they fail (error = 1),
  no saturation-like properties can be offered.
